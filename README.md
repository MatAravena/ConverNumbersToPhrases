# ConverNumbersToPhrases
Personal comments....

I started within the BE to 'translate' the words and thought about it as a Spanish speacks read the numbers and then I realized that I could improve the code adding recursivity in the same method.

Then trying to solved how to select the last number to be found as text search a cool way to used mod within the remainder in the division. So the mod gave me obviously another idea to improve even more the code trying to not use all the time the substring used above in the class ...
but I was running out of time and had several issues with React and the states, the way to display the right format required I leave the code like that
obviesly could be improve and reduce planty of code

Hopefully but unlikely this will help anyone in the future xD
